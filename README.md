Code and data for "Label-Driven Denoising Framework for Multi-Label Few-Shot
Aspect Category Detection" (Finding of EMNLP 2022)

## Overview

<img src="figs/EMNLP2022_LDF.png" style="width:200px height:300px" />

- In this paper, we propose a Label-Driven Denoising Framework (LDF) to alleviate the noise problems for the FS-ACD task.
- Label-Driven Denoising Framework contains a label-guided attention strategy to filter noisy words and generate a representative prototype for each aspect, and a label-weighted contrastive loss to avoid generating similar prototypes for
semantically-close aspect categories.
